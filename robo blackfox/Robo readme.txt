Notes: 

I tried to keep the rig as simple and minimal but flexible and versatile. If you encounter any problem or lack of something in the rig I will be more than happy to receive your feedbacks and comments.

Also in maya version, It is suggested that you add this mel command < select "*CTRL"; > to your custom shelf for selecting all the controllers at once, else you can use CTRLs Layer for selecting them or just simply use the provided character set (roboCharSET) to key them all at once. 

For the fingers there is no controller, thus you need to animate them in the old fashioned geometry-fk-fingers way, which I (as an animator) still prefer it!



New Features:

- Improved foot controllers
- Fk/Ik Arm
- Improved spine controller
- Improved UV map with a new texture sheet
- Improved geometry
- Some fixed errors
